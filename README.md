  ## Description
  The purpose of this project is to automate the creation of the README file necessary for all GitHub repositories so that proper instructions, installations, and any other messages that need to be conveyed to the user are shared properly. This way the repository owner can rest assured that the intent and use of this repository can be followed as intended. By allowing users a systematic way of creating README files, future repositories can be documented in a neat, readable, and presentable format.

  ## Installation
  In order to install and use make sure to initiate using: 
  ```
  npm install
  ```
  This will ensure that everything is setup correctly and the dependancies needed are in place.

  ## Tests
  For testing purposes you can use the following command:
  ```
  npm test
  ```

  ## Usage
  This repository is a Command Line Interface tool. In order to use it properly the repository should be cloned and the installation instructions should be followed. Once properly installed, the AUTO-README tool will make a new README file in the directory it is invoked in. Simply follow and answer the prompts asked in the command line and once all questions are completed, a new README.md file should appear in the same folder. Be advised this will overwrite any existing file with the same file name 'README.md'.
